üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Andrea, a self-employed engineer who creates mathematical models of sport physiology and performance.

I love to work on:

ü´Å Deep learning technologies to process cardiopulmonary exercise test data

üö¥ Studying cornering strategies in road cycling

My philosophy
======
I‚Äôm equally interested in each phase of modeling: conceptualization and formalization, data collection and processing, model development, and model deployment. I always value models that can teach us more in return. I love adding intelligence to the process. Ironically, more intelligence usually means less technology. And that‚Äôs the way it should be: sensors come and go, but learning is forever.

Why mathematical models?
======
Modeling lies at the heart of how we understand the world and its emerging properties. Mathematical modeling, in particular, describes a system using mathematical terms. The clear advantage of having our models written in a communicable language is that we can share our ideas with the world. If we are lucky enough, we share ideas that are both innovative and helpful, and we get to participate in advancing human knowledge.

Why sport physiology and performance?
======
I enrolled in an engineering course to study robotics and ended up studying the most wonderfully made machine: the human body. Sport performance requires a combination of the best qualities of the human body, making it human movement in its best form. Physiology is what makes movement possible, hence human movement in its fundamental terms.
