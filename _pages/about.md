ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Andrea, a self-employed engineer who creates mathematical models of sport physiology and performance. 

Why mathematical models?
======
Modelling lies at the heart of how we understand the world and its emerging properties. *Mathematical* modelling, in particular, is the process to describe a system with mathematical terms. 

The clear advantage of having our models written in a communicable language is that we can share our ideas with the world. If we are lucky enough, we share ideas that can be both innovative and helpful, and we get to participate in advancing the human knowledge. 

Why sport physiology and performance?
======
I enrolled in an engineering course to study robotics, and I ended up by studying the most wondefully made machine: the human body. Sport performance requires a combination of the best qualities of a human body, hence is human movement in its best form. Physiology is what makes movement possible, hence is human movement in its fundametal terms.
