I help sport tech startups turn physiology and performance data into production-ready AI solutions that drive subscriptions, enhance UX, and deliver new features.

I bridge the gap between sports science research and deployed code. I speak both languages: I can whiteboard with exercise physiologists in the morning and ship containerized APIs by evening.

# What I do

I build and deploy AI-powered models for endurance sport performance:

- **Training prescription & assessment** - Algorithms that adapt to individual athletes
- **Cardiopulmonary exercise testing** - ML models for threshold detection and interpretation
- **Continuous Glucose Monitoring** - Insights extraction for metabolic optimization
- **Pacing & race strategy** - Simulation models for optimal performance

I work across the full stack: from research and model development to Docker containers, Flask/FastAPI services, and production deployment on AWS, Heroku, or Lambda.

# How I work

I combine first-principles modeling with machine learning. Depending on the problem, I write differential equations by hand, train neural networks, or blend both approaches. I prototype fast, validate against real data, and iterate until the model delivers business value.

**Tech stack:** Python, Claude Code, Flask, FastAPI, Docker, AWS Lambda, Heroku, LLM pipelines

**Recent work:** Educational courses, performance models deployed as APIs, webapps connected to CMS via LLM pipelines.

# Background

**M.Eng. Mechatronics** + **PhD Sports Science** - I enrolled to study robotics and ended up studying the most wonderfully made machine: the human body.

I maintain active research collaborations and publish in peer-reviewed journals. I'm Associate Editor at Sports Engineering and reviewer for several top sports science journals.

**Clients & collaborations:** Athletica.ai, Supersapiens, and other sport tech startups building cutting-edge technologies.
