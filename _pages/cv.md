## Technical Stack

I bring over **10 years of experience** in developing complex mathematical models. My foundational work in academia involved extensive use of **Matlab** for numerical simulations and **Maple** for symbolic equation manipulation.

More recently, in startup environments, I've accumulated **over 8 years of experience with Python**, leveraging libraries such as **Pandas** for data manipulation, **scikit-learn** for machine learning model development, and **Keras** / **TensorFlow** for deep learning applications. I am proficient in **time- and frequency-domain signal processing techniques**, including filter design and power spectrum analysis. For statistical analyses and data reporting, I frequently utilize **R** and its powerful libraries like **dplyr** and **ggplot**.

I collaborate closely with full-stack and backend developers, and I have hands-on experience using **Docker** for containerized application deployment and **Heroku** and **AWS Lightsail** for deployment. I develop **API endpoints** using frameworks like **Tornado**, **Flask**, and **FastAPI**. My project collaboration experience includes sharing **Git** repositories across **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **Bitbucket**. I am also adept at **project tracking and issue reporting** using tools such as **Trello**, **Slack**, **Linear**, and **Monday**.
