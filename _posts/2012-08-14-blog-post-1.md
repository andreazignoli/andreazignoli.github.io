In this [post](https://hiitscience.com/the-greatest-show-on-earth/), I discuss how AI techonologies might assist us to monitor and optimize the chronic physiological adaptations that occur with endurance training, as well as how AI models might be used subsequently to develop more data-driven and systematic approaches to training program design.

In particular my discussion will be divided into two main sections: *independency* and *intelligence* (of a virtual coach).
