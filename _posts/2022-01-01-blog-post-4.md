# *Bike handling*: what is it and why should anyone care?

I think that *bike handling* in road cycling is often discussed with poor level of details. There are at least two points of view, and mixing them up is not going to help, so let's be sure they are two different pathways that lead to distinct abilities:

* üö¥ __Sport science__: for many, bike handling is synonim for *technical skills*, which translates in the ability of one-hand riding, effective and considerate obstacle avoidance, stoppie-wheelie tricks, navigating the pack, etc. 
* üö≤üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë __Vehicle dynamics__: bike handling has more to do with the performance of the bike-rider coupling, i.e.: the ability that the riders have to consciously explore the limits of their bike.  

The first point of view quickly translates in a safer ride, but it's hard to find the association with cycling performance. For some, *bike handling* is about *dealing with the unexpected*, but for me it's more about knowing *what to expect* from your bike. Hence, I support the second point of view and I never mix *bike handling* with *technical skills*.  

The possible reasons why *bike handling* is poorly studied might be: 

* It is not perceived as important as other physiological abilities
* It is difficult to assess due to logistic and safety reasons

In this blog post I will try to give an idea about:

* The impact that bike handling can have on the overall cycling performance
* The tools we have to assess bike handling with 'cost effective' instrumentation
