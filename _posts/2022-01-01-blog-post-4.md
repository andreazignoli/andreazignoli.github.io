# *Bike handling*: what is it and why should anyone care?

I think that *bike handling* in road cycling is often discussed with poor level of details. There are at least two points of view, and mixing them up is not going to help, so let's be sure they are two different pathways that lead to distinct abilities:

* üö¥ __Sport science__: from this point of view, bike handling is synonim for *technical skills*, which translates in the ability of one-hand riding, effective and considerate obstacle avoidance, stoppie-wheelie tricks, navigating the pack, etc. 
* üö≤üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë __Vehicle dynamics__: from this point of view, bike handling has more to do with the performance of the bike-rider coupling, i.e.: the ability that the riders have to consciously explore the limits of their bike.  

The first point of view quickly translates in a safer ride, but it's hard to find the association with cycling performance. For some, *bike handling* is about *dealing with the unexpected*, but for me it's more about knowing *what to expect* from the bike. Hence, I support the second point of view, and I never mix *bike handling* with *technical skills*.  

The possible reasons why *bike handling* is poorly studied might be: 

* It is not perceived as important as other physiological abilities
* It is difficult to assess due to logistic and safety reasons

In this blog post I will try to give an idea about:

* The impact that bike handling can have on the overall cycling performance
* The tools we have to assess bike handling with 'cost effective' instrumentation

# The gg diagram

The gg diagram is widely used in motor racing to depict the accelerations of a vehicle in the road plane. In the following picture the structure of the gg diagram is presented. On the x-axis, lateral accelerations are reported. On the y-axis, longitudinal accelerations are reported. These accelerations are the highest during strong sprint efforts, rapid changes in road slope and hard braking.

A wind rose has been included in the middle to better understand how to read the diagram. 

*East* and *West* represent high lateral accelerations, typically high during high-speed corners. At *North*, we have strong accelerations, typically high when there is asudden decrease in road slope or there is a strong sprinting action going on. At *South*, we have large decelerations, hence index of rapid increase in road slope or hard braking actions. Combinations are of course possible: at SW and SE we see combinations of lateral and negative accelerations (e.g., cornering and braking together), at NW and NE we see combinations of lateral and positive accelerations (e.g., cornering and accelerating together). 

Some imagination is required to read the diagram. In the follwing picture two different cornering maneouvers are represented. While approaching the corner two riders have constant velocity, hence they are in the middle of the diagram. While approaching the corner the 'black arrow rider' brakes and turns with two very distinct actions: first a strong deceleration heading South in our wind rose is measured, second a strong lateral acceleration heading East is measured. The result is the typical cross shape. While approaching the corner the 'red arrow rider' starts braking and cornering at the same time: a first deceleration heading South progressively heads SE, then E and finally the center of the diagram again.

So we introduced the gg diagram as a tool to describe riding behaviour, but what about performance? Well, evaluating the gg diagram in isolation for a single rider in a single corner or race section might lead to erroneous conclusions. If possibile, the gg diagram should be used to compare riders or settings. Below, I provide an interesting comparison between bikes (bicycles) (red line), 125 cc motorcycles (blue line) and 1000 cc Superbikes (yellow line). The data has been kindly provided by Prof. [F. Biral](https://webapps.unitn.it/du/en/Persona/PER0004552/Pubblicazioni) and they have been collected on the [Mugello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugello_Circuit) circuit during testing sessions.

It is pretty apparent that motorcycles can produce higher accelerations in both longitudinal and lateral directions. As you can see, heavy 1000 cc bikes can sustain also strong combinations of lateral and longitudinal accelerations.
