# The *chasm* between AI and clinical implementation

The number of applications of AI to health care and health-related fields has been exponentially growing in the last decade. However, of all the algorithms developed, a minor fraction of them is actually implemented in the clinical practice. This gap is also known as AI *chasm*. 


The cognitive load, i.e. the mental effort required to perform a task. 

Any AI system that can actually decrease the cognitive load of a clinician should be therefore prioritized. 

Additional cognitive load can come from those implementations that suffer from excessive false alarms and complex explanatory visualizations.
