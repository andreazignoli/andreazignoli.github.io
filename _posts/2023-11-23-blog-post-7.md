To travel along a circular path, an object needs to be subject to a centripetal acceleration (for example: the Moon circles around the Earth because of gravity; a car turns its front wheels inward to generate a centripetal force).

If a vehicle traveling on a straight path were to suddenly transition to a circular path, it would require centripetal acceleration suddenly switching at the tangent point from zero to the required value; this would be difficult to achieve (think of a driver instantly moving the steering wheel from straight line to turning position, and the car actually doing it), putting mechanical stress on the vehicle's parts, and causing much discomfort (due to lateral jerk).

On early railroads this instant application of lateral force was not an issue since low speeds and wide-radius curves were employed (lateral forces on the passengers and the lateral sway was small and tolerable). As speeds of rail vehicles increased over the years, it became obvious that an easement is necessary, so that the centripetal acceleration increases linearly with the traveled distance. Given the expression of centripetal acceleration 

$$a_c=v^2/r$$

If a vehicle traveling on a straight path were to suddenly transition to a circular path, it would require centripetal acceleration suddenly switching at the tangent point from zero to the required value; this would be difficult to achieve (think of a driver instantly moving the steering wheel from straight line to turning position, and the car actually doing it), putting mechanical stress on the vehicle's parts, and causing much discomfort (due to lateral jerk).

the obvious solution is to provide an easement curve whose curvature, 


$$k=1/R$$

increases linearly with the traveled distance. This geometry is an "clothoids", another name for the Euler spiral.[3]

Euler spirals are in fact widely used in rail and highway engineering for providing a transition or an easement between a tangent and a horizontal circular curve.

Drawing clothoids instead of circles is a design choice made in road and rail engineering, particularly in designing curves and transitions. The reason behind using clothoids, also known as Euler spirals, comes down to providing a smooth transition between straight paths and circular curves.

When simulating human movement, modeling the optimization processes occurring in the mind is the best approach. However, for the virtual simulation to be accurate, you not only need a physical model but also need to understand the actual objective function that the human is attempting to optimize. In a race, riders aim to optimize for time, but not all compete to win or go full throttle due to strategic reasons related to general classification, team duties, or a lack of interest in stage wins.

Additionally, other factors may come into play. One common element considered is the smoothness of the trajectory or its inverse concept, jerk. Jerk is calculated as the derivative of acceleration, representing the variation in acceleration. Riders executing jerky movements are less likely to navigate corners effectively. Rough road surfaces, wet wheel rims, sharp steering adjustments, and overreacting to bumps are all factors that impede the smooth execution of actions and cornering.

So, your best bet, when you need to fit GPS data to find trajectory, is most likely to use clothoids.
