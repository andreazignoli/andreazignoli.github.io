# Trajectories in nature

What does an eagle that hunts a prey on the ground have in common with sunflowers? ðŸ¦… ðŸŒ» Well, both the trajectory of the eagle and the disposition of the seeds of the sunflower seem to share the same mathematical structure: that of a spiral following a Fibonacci pattern. 

In nature, spirals come in many forms, but there isn't a clear classification for all of them. While some, like fern buds, are easily recognized as spirals, others aren't as obvious. Interestingly, humans have created spiral shapes that don't exist in nature. This blog post looks at one such spiral called the **clothoid**, which isn't found in nature. 

It looks like nature loves smooth changes and pleasing curves. In one simple quote:

In the present blog, we introduce and discuss a fascinating question. Is there a case to be made that cyclists trace clothoids while descending?

## Of railways and clothoids

To travel along a circular path, an object needs to be subject to a centripetal acceleration (for example: the Moon circles around the Earth because of gravity; a car turns its front wheels inward to generate a centripetal force).

If a vehicle traveling on a straight path were to suddenly transition to a circular path, it would require centripetal acceleration suddenly switching at the tangent point from zero to the required value; this would be difficult to achieve. Think of a train instantly moving from straight line to turning position, and the train cars actually doing it, putting mechanical stress on the train's parts, and causing much discomfort to the passengers.

In the past, on early railroads this instant application of lateral force was not an issue since low speeds and wide-radius curves were employed (lateral forces on the passengers and the lateral sway was small and tolerable). As speeds of rail vehicles increased over the years, it became obvious that an easement is necessary, so that the centripetal acceleration increases gently (e.g. linearly) with the traveled distance. Given the expression of centripetal acceleration: 

$$a_c=v^2/r$$

if a vehicle traveling on a straight path were to suddenly transition to a circular path, it would require centripetal acceleration suddenly switching at the tangent point from zero to the required value; this would be difficult to achieve (think of a driver instantly moving the steering wheel from straight line to turning position, and the car actually doing it), putting mechanical stress on the vehicle's parts, and causing much discomfort (due to lateral jerk).

The obvious solution is to provide an easement curve whose curvature: 

$$k=1/R$$

increases linearly with the traveled distance. This geometry is a "clothoids", another name for the Euler spiral. Nowadays, drawing clothoids instead of circles is a design choice made in road and rail engineering, particularly in designing curves and transitions. Indeed, the reason behind using clothoids comes down to providing a smooth transition between straight paths and circular curves.

## Now, you might ponder, what does this have to do with cycling? 

Human movement is all about optimisation, becasue it is all about finding the most convenient way in which the movement is planned and executed. Human body possesses a high degree of redundancy, e.g.: 1) there are an incredible number of joints in the human body and the same end-point might be reached with a different combination of angular joint angles; 2) there are multiple motoneurons activating a single muscle, and multiple muscles moving a single articular joint, so muscle recruitment has to weigh in the "biomechanical" convenience of the single muscles (fiber typology, moment arm, position, speed of contraction, etc.); 3) on a higher level, a person might go from point A to point B with different trajectories, or a different distribution of intensity along the course (i.e. different pacing strategies). The list of examples could go on and on and on.

It is usually believed that humans minimise energy consumption, or perceived effort, or a balance between the effort they perceive and the one they think they should perceive. Anyway, the choices that humans made when performing a movement, which might entail reaching out to grasp a pen or completing a cycling trajectory, might be done partly consciously and partly unconsciously. What the human body is truly trying to optimise for, is currently debated and one of the most exciting challenges in the field of motor control studies. 

Let's stick to cycling though, with the example of an individual time trial. During a race, riders aim to optimize for arrival time, but not all compete to win or go full throttle due to strategic reasons related to general classification, team duties, or a lack of interest in stage wins. So, we might ask ourselves if there is a factor which is common to all. 

One common element often considered is the smoothness of the trajectory or its inverse concept, the jerk. Jerk is calculated as the derivative of acceleration, representing the variation in acceleration, and can be computed for body joint accelerations and torques alike. Riders executing jerky movements are less likely to navigate corners effectively. Rough road surfaces, wet wheel rims, sharp steering adjustments, and overreacting to bumps are all factors that impede the smooth execution of actions and cornering.

Clothoids are often used because they provide a gradual change in curvature, which helps minimize discomfort for the driver and reduce wear and tear on vehicles.

## Practical application

OK, Andrea, but please what do I need to know this for? Well, let's assume you are collecting GPS positions every second, how do you connect those points? Now, you should already now what I would suggest. Your best bet is to take the GPS points and fit them with clothoids.
