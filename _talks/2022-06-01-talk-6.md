ðŸ¤– AI COACHING & PERIODIZATION is NOT what you THINK IT IS!

Now you might think that AI just does EVERYTHING by itself, hey ðŸ™ƒ? No one else and nothing else needed?

Well, Dr Andrea Zignoli, part of our @athletica_ai team, is here to tell you otherwise.

Paul and Andrea discuss what an AI can BE and what it DEFINITELY IS NOT, how we need to consider our MORALS and LAWS for applying training with the help of AI, as well as in quite some detail how ATHLETICA can help you LEVERAGE all available HIIT SCIENCE knowledge, while still allowing for ALL the subjective factors & experience!
