💥 AI in COACHING & TRAINING – Revolutionizing Performance 🚀

Dr. Andrea Zignoli wants you to understand that before AI can be useful in coaching and training, modelling must come first.

In Episode 157 of The Training Science Podcast, Andrea returns to unpack how models like Critical Power, Banister TRIMP, and HRV response curves provide the structure AI needs to make smart, adaptable decisions. This is the foundation of Athletica’s AI-driven training—and why it matters now more than ever.
